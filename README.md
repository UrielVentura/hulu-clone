This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a Next.js project, when I tried to replicate a simple part of the User interface of the hulu website. In this project I used **TailwindCSS** to styling this UI.

## Installation

First, run :

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
